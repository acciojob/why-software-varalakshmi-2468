 <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
    <p>
        I want to become a software developer because I am passionate about technology and problem-solving. 
        Writing code allows me to build solutions that can make life easier for people, automate tasks, and 
        create innovative products. I am motivated by the idea that as a developer, I can continuously learn 
        new skills, work on exciting projects, and contribute to shaping the future of technology. 
        Becoming a developer will also give me the opportunity to collaborate with creative people and 
        bring ideas to life through software.
